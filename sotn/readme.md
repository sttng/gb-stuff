# Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night [Game.com – Cancelled] 

A portable version of Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night was in development for the [Game.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game.com), the ill-fated handled console created by Tiger Electronics in 1997, but soon the project vanished in the vaporware limbo and it’s unknown how much of the game was really completed before the cancellation. As other [Game.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game.com) titles (see Resident Evil 2), this Castlevania should have been a “downgraded port” of the Playstation / Saturn Symphony Of The Night, with some evident differences for the limits of the hardware.
